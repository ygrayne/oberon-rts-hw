# Platforms

## Status

There are two platforms with the required functionality to support a simplified version of Oberon RTS (as well as EPO), while bringing back the basic functionality.

* p3-eth-arty-a7-100
* p4-thm-de2-115

Support the same version of Oberon RTS, ie. swapping the SD card is possible.
