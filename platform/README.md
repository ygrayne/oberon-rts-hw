# Platforms

## Next Up

Add two platforms with minimum functionality to support a stripped down version of Oberon RTS:

* p3-eth-arty-a7-100
* p4-thm-de2-115

Support the same version of Oberon RTS, ie. swapping the SD card is possible. Then, both the software and hardware are "brought back" to full functionality, in lock-step, with careful re-consideration of all concepts and their implementation.
