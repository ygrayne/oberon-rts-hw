## p4-eth-arty-a7-100

## Overview

* Architecture: ETH
* Board: Digilent Arty-A7-100

## Purpose and Status

To develop p3, a reference platform that actually works, is useful. At the starting point, it corresponded to p1. The plan is to first strip down this platform to the bare minimum and still have a working Oberon RTS system. This shall be the initial form of p3.

In parallel, all software access and use of the removed hardware elements has been removed as well.

See RISC5Top.v for a list of removed elements.
